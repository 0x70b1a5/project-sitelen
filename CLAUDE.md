## Project Vision: Sitelen Sitelen Graphics Creator

The goal of this project is to build a web-based tool for creating Sitelen Sitelen graphics with the following capabilities:

1. Allow users to create and manipulate glyphs in a grid interface
2. Support dragging, resizing, and precise positioning of elements
3. Implement nested structure of glyphs (glyphs can contain other glyphs)
4. Handle the specialized stretching behavior where certain components of glyphs should stretch while others maintain constant size
5. Support the unique visual language of Sitelen Sitelen with its hierarchical and container-based layout

## Development Commands
- Run the app: Open index.html in a browser
- No build process currently established

## Code Style
- Use vanilla JavaScript with modern ES6+ features
- Maintain clean, well-commented code
- Follow component-based architecture
- Prioritize accessibility and responsive design
